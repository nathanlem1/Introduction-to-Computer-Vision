# Introduction to Computer Vision

In this repo, we provide a brief introduction to computer vision, both 2D and 3D computer vision, for beginners who want 
to join the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly computer vision. This introduction to computer vision has two 
parts: 

1. [Part 1](https://github.com/nathanlem1/Introduction-to-Computer-Vision/blob/main/Computer_Vision_Part_1.pdf) which covers introduction to 2D computer vision, and 
2. [Part 2](https://github.com/nathanlem1/Introduction-to-Computer-Vision/blob/main/Computer_Vision_Part_2.pdf) which covers introduction to 3D computer vision.

Many people use AI and machine learning (ML) interchangeably. If you want to know their difference and relationship, look at
[AI-ML](https://github.com/nathanlem1/Introduction-to-Computer-Vision/blob/main/AI_ML.pdf).

NOTE: If you want to do research, you need to remember Arthur L. Schawlow's quote: "To do successful research, you don't need to 
know everything, you just need to know one thing that is not known."
